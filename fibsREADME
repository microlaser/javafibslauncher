This is a simple shell script and launcher to start java fibs on modern Linux.  I have tested this on ubnuntu 20.04 and Debian 10.  This old java code has a bug in the way the images are packaged which makes them only load when you start the java in the same directory the game is in.  I offered my help to the developer of this closed source application and was ignored.  My wife likes this game so I wrote this script so she can start it easily.  She encouraged me to post this simple code publically for users that want to play java fibs on Linux.
